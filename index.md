Hi everybody, welcome to SenicTeam.io! This has been a long time coming. Ever since last month I've been trying to create some sort of SenicTeam website, and here we are now. I would also like to mention that this site is still in beta. None of the .ips roms have been made yet, so sadly there is no way to download Senic 1/2 so far. Other links are coming, like S3VIV & FSF, so please be patient while we work everything out. With that being said, please have fun!
